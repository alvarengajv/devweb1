          Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ; Portuguese: jiu-jitsu brasileiro) is a
          self-defence martial art and combat sport based on grappling, ground
          fighting, and submission holds. BJJ approaches self-defense by
          emphasizing taking an opponent to the ground, gaining a dominant
          position, and using a number of techniques to force them into
          submission via joint locks or chokeholds. Brazilian jiu-jitsu was
          initially developed in 1925 by Brazilian brothers Carlos, Oswaldo,
          Gastão Jr., O’Brien, and Hélio Gracie, after Carlos was taught
          jiu-jitsu by a travelling Japanese judoka, Mitsuyo Maeda, in 1917.
          Later on, the Gracie family developed their own self-defense system,
          and published Gracie Jiu-Jitsu. BJJ eventually came to be its own
          defined combat sport through the innovations, practices, and
          adaptation of Gracie jiu-jitsu and Judo, and became an essential
          martial art for modern MMA. BJJ revolves around the concept that a
          smaller, weaker person can successfully defend themselves against a
          bigger, stronger, heavier opponent by using leverage and weight
          distribution, taking the fight to the ground and using a number of
          holds and submissions to defeat them. BJJ training can be used for
          sport grappling and self-defense situations. Sparring, commonly
          referred to as "rolling" within the BJJ community, and live drilling
          plays a major role in training and the practitioner's development. BJJ
          can also be used as a method of promoting physical fitness, building
          character, and as a way of life.

        <p style="text-align: justify" ;>
          The Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioner's uniform commonly referred to as
          gi or kimono is similar to a judogi, but with slight differences in
          the dimensions and often made of lighter material with tighter cuffs
          on the pants and jacket. This allows the practitioner to benefit from
          a closer fit, providing less material for an opponent to manipulate.
          Traditionally, to be promoted in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the wearing of
          the Jiu-Jitsu gi while training is a requirement. Recently with the
          growing popularity of "no-gi" Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu has the practice of
          giving out belts to no-gi practitioners (e.g., Rolles Gracie awarding
          Rashad Evans a black belt) has become more common. There are certain
          differences between gi jiu-jitsu and "no-gi" jiu-jitsu. In gi
          jiu-jitsu one can grip an opponent's uniform, using it to submit or
          advance position. There are a number of submissions that are specific
          to the gi, such as the "Loop choke", "Collar choke", and others. A
          specific set of rules to guide no-gi competitions is issued by the
          IBJJF, but there may be variation in the set of rules applied in each
          competition. By IBJJF rules uniform grips are not permitted in "no-gi"
          jiu-jitsu. No-gi Jiu-Jitsu practitioners, therefore, don't wear the
          traditional gi or kimono (which increases the athlete's weight and
          limits mobility). BJJ athletes who practice no-gi usually wear a rash
          guard and MMA shorts or Spats.
